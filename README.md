# Project-Journey

A Java based skeleton of a game.

---

## Description

This is the start of a game idea I had, fully functional but mostly featureless.
As a hobby project, the purpose was to gain experience in Java as well as test my skills.

It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows arrow-key motion across a finite and randomly generated 2D tiled terrain, as well as limited text input.
There is almost nothing to do, other than explore the terrain.

This code is written by me in Java using NetBeans. Some of the code was auto-generated by NetBeans.

## Note on running

My IDEs (NetBeans, and VS Code) allow me to run the code straight from the IDE without terminal usage, so I will not provide terminal instructions on how to run the project.
Instead I suggest to use a similar IDE; VS Code seems to handle opening a pre-existing project fine.

The `main` method is located in ./src/project/journey/ProjectJourney.java
